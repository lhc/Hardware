nodeLHC

This board was developed at the Campinas Hacker Lab in Brazil during our weekly IoT meetings. This layout and schematic was developed by Leandro Pereira.

The idea was to develop a easy to use board and to learn how to use this magnificent WiFi module.

We are not selling it but you can build your own borad if you want!!!

This board is full compatible with nodeMCU, Arduino IDE, native development and any other firmware avaliable.
